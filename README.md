*Over there, just beneath the moon*  
There's a man with a burden to keep  
Now, sleep will fall, washout rags and paper bags  
Homes and lives passing by  

***Who will see the beauty in your life?***  
And who will be there to hear you when you call?  
***Who will see the madness in your life?***  
And who will be there to catch you if you fall?  

<i>- Beauty and Madness by Fra Lippo Lippi</i>
